#Wasp
Wasp is a wrapper for network libraries in order to make it simple. Currently volley is used as default current
network stack. The idea is to get rid of request classes and gather them into one place and easy to access with the
maximum readability and easiness. The idea is the same with retrofit (Thanks).
